# SwiftIvarTypeDetector

This is a very simple project that wraps `ivar_getTypeEncodingSwift` from @johnno1962's [XprobePlugin](https://github.com/johnno1962/XprobePlugin) to easily print out the type encoding for properties in a Swift class.

## Usage

Modify `SwiftIvarTypeDetectorTests.swift` and run the tests (`âŒ˜+U`) to print out the properties on any Swift class.

This project requires Xcode 6 (betas 1/2/3 all work).

This release includes a very slightly modified version of the excellent canviz library to render "dot" files in an HTML canvas which is subject to an MIT license. The changes are to pass through the ID of the node to the node label tag (line 212), to reverse the rendering of nodes and the lines linking them (line 406) and to store edge paths so they can be colored (line 66 and 303) in "canviz-0.1/canviz.js".
