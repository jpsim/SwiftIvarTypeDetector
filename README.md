# SwiftIvarTypeDetector

This is a very simple project that wraps `ivar_getTypeEncodingSwift` from @johnno1962's [XprobePlugin](https://github.com/johnno1962/XprobePlugin) to easily print out the type encoding for properties in a Swift class.

## Usage

Modify `SwiftIvarTypeDetectorTests.swift` and run the tests (`âŒ˜+U`) to print out the properties on any Swift class.

This project requires Xcode 6 (only betas 5 & 6 work as of 21/08/2014).
